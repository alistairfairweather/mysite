I don't usually publish press releases but this isn't available anywhere yet, and I think it's topical:
<blockquote><b>The DMMA joins global digital body and rebrands as IAB South Africa. </b>__________________________________________________________________________________<b></b>

<i>February 3, 2014.</i> The DMMA (Digital Media &amp; Marketing Association) joins the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), which is dedicated to growing the global digital industry. From today, the DMMA will be known as the IAB South Africa.

“IABs around the world help build markets; bring likeminded members together and ensure that standards and guidelines are set for global best practice,” says Jarred Cinman, Chair of the IAB South Africa. “This intent sits perfectly with what the DMMA has been working towards since its inception ten years ago.”

“There are some very clear benefits to being part of an established and respected global network,” says Cinman. “It gives us the ability to be part of IAB global standards, to replicate key international research studies to see how South Africa fares in a global context, as well as giving us a seat at the international IAB table with access to case studies of successful strategies in other markets. In short, being part of the IAB gives our members access to international knowledge and best practice, while ensuring that South Africa takes part in the global, digital, conversation.”

All IABs function completely autonomously, and one key requirement is that each IAB is committed to the goal of growing the online media and advertising industry. “As this goal lies at the core of the IAB South Africa’s constitution, there is no need for changes to the structures, processes and policies of how the DMMA was run,” says Cinman.

At the AGM in August 2013, the membership of the DMMA voted in favour of pursuing an opportunity to become the official South African chapter of the IAB. Within this directive, two members of the DMMA Board (Timothy Spira, representing publishers, and Fred Roed, representing agencies) met with the IAB at its headquarters in New York in September 2013. Based on these and subsequent discussions, the IAB officially extended the offer to the DMMA to join. Communication was sent out to the DMMA members during December 2013 to vote on the change. The motion was passed at the agreement of its members; and the IAB licencing agreement was received at the beginning of January 2014.

“With the launch of IAB South Africa, there are now IABs on all the world’s continents except Antarctica,” said David Doty, Executive Vice President and CMO, IAB, who also heads the organization’s international efforts. “With an already proven track record of moving the digital industry forward in one of the world’s key markets, Jarred Cinman and his team bring a level of expertise and knowledge to the newest IAB that is not only of tremendous benefit in their country, but to our global members that are looking to build relationships in South Africa and to our network of 41 of IABs around the world.”

The IAB South Africa’s commitment to growing South African’s digital media industry by strengthening the credibility of its single measurement currency remains central to its mandate and activity. “Of all the DMMA’s activities in the past year, this has been the most direct benefit to all of our members. The needs and requirements of digital publishers are at the core of our organisation. Encouraging advertisers to allocate more of their budget to local digital publishers will create benefit for all members, and will provide the fuel to grow our entire industry. The DMMA today, and the IAB South Africa of the future, acknowledges that this is, and remains, our central purpose. Becoming an IAB will only add credibility and impetus to this goal,” concludes Cinman.</blockquote>
