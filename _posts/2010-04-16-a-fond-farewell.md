I wrote my last column for <a href="http://www.news24.com/Content/Columnists/AlistairFairweather/">News24</a> this week. After nearly two years of calling it my home I&#39;m sad to be leaving. I&#39;ve written around 70 columns in that time, which equates to around 35,000 words, or one (very discontinuous) novella on technology. It seems like an age ago that I took my first faltering steps as a columnist - writing as a &quot;guest columnist&quot; about <a href="http://www.news24.com/Columnists/GuestColumn/Walking-on-AIR-20080516">Adobe AIR</a>. I will always be grateful to <a href="http://twitter.com/JannieMom">Jannie</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/CathrynR">Cathryn</a> who trusted me to speak sense to their 1 million readers.<p /> Have no fear though, faithful reader, I haven&#39;t stopped writing, I&#39;ve merely moved venues. From this Wednesday onwards I will will be writing a weekly column for the Mail &amp; Guardian Online. My first one, about <a href="http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-04-14-biz-gets-a-model">Twitter&#39;s business model</a>, is already live and kicking. I&#39;m also going to be writing for <a href="http://memeburn.com/">memeburn</a> when I have the time and the insight. My<a href="http://memeburn.com/2010/04/avoid-these-10-common-mistakes-made-by-brands-on-facebook/"> first article</a> there was an unexpected success, and I&#39;m busy cooking up a few more.
