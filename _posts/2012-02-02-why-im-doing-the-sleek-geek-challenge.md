For the first thirty years of my life I never struggled with weight. I ate what I wanted, exercised a fair amount and everything ticked along merrily. Eventually, though, the creeping neglect got me. Over the last three or four years I've steadily put on weight, and now I'm at nearly 90KG - a good 10KG more than I should probably weigh.
