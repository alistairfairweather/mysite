If there was ever a world cup of euphemisms "premium mobile services" would be right up there in the semis. You know the kind of crap I mean - "your daily horoscope, only R5 per week".

Our mobile networks claim that it's hard to be subscribed to these services without realising it, but our intrepid business writer, Lisa Steyn, begs to differ. She's found a way that anyone can tell, immediately, if they're subscribed to anything dodgy. See below for details:
<blockquote><strong>To block all existing content billing on:</strong>

Cell C – use the USSD string *133*1#

For Vodacom – sms “STOP ALL” to 30333 (note: if you receive a message saying it was unsuccessful it means you weren’t subscribed to anything)

On MTN you can dial *141*5# to manage subscriptions and individually select what you wish to unsubscribe from.

Telkom don’t allow these guys to use their network (yet).</blockquote>
If you find you you were subscribed without knowing it, please let us know in the comments or on Twitter. You might end up famous and in the paper and shit.
