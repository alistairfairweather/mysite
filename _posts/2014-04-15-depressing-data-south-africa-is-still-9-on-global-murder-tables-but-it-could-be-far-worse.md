I'm not normally a data hound (even though I love the discipline) but when I stumbled on this tweet:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">Murder rate rank 2012 1 Honduras 2 Venezuela 16 Brazil 20 Mexico 55 Russia 89 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23US&amp;src=hash">#US</a> 102 India 126 Canada 155 Singapore <a href="http://t.co/cSDQcakVCr">pic.twitter.com/cSDQcakVCr</a>

...it made me wonder where the good old RSA ranked. Alas, the answer is not exactly encouraging:

What <em>is</em> encouraging, if you dig a little deeper, is how much better we're doing than 14 years ago. Back in 2000 our murder rate was nearly 50 per 100,000 people. That placed us at #3 in the murder rates, behind Colombia and Honduras. And while our murder rate (along with Colombia's) has gradually improved, Honduras's has only gotten worse. So, we should be grateful for that blessing at the very least.
